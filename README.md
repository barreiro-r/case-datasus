This project explores chemotherapy-related healthcare data from Brazilâ€™s DataSUS system, focusing on patterns of treatment, patient demographics, and healthcare service utilization. The analysis was conducted using Python for data wrangling and preprocessing, and Tableau for interactive visualization.

### Key highlights:

- Cleaned and structured APAC (Ambulatory Care Authorization) data with a focus on oncology.
- Generated insights on treatment frequency, cost, and patient distribution.
- Built a Tableau dashboard for intuitive exploration of chemotherapy data across time and regions.
